# Basic Calculator in C++

## Description
This is a simple command-line calculator written in C++. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

## Features
- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Enter the second number.
4. Choose an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
5. View the calculated result.

## Example
```
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 5
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, %): *
Result: 50
```

## Compilation & Execution
To compile the program, use the following command:
```sh
g++ -o calculator main.cpp
```
To run the program:
```sh
./calculator
```

## Future Improvements
- Add support for floating-point numbers.
- Implement additional mathematical functions.
